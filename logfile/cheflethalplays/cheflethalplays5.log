[07:39:44] <Mellowcanuck> That's a big ass piece of meat
[07:39:49] <GosuCat> @cheflethalbot, do you also prepare healthy foods on special days?
[07:40:00] <rainbows1234> this makes me so sick watching
[07:40:03] <TheSailCat> I need to start cooking, Eating Captain Crunch for dinner isnt going to cut it when watching Chef make awesome food.
[07:40:04] <Shadowxdemon0> i want to rub that 'meat' KappaPride
[07:40:11] <Gotycki_Rosa> lol
[07:40:15] <@^cheflethalbot> Are you a streamer, or know someone who is and would like to potentially mess with Chef's stream?! Now you can with the Wheels of Spinach RAID GAME! Consisting of up to 3 rounds, raiders who bring along at least 5 viewers can test their luck by choosing to spin the wheels and potentially ruin Chef's plan for the stream!
[07:40:19] <+Mrs_Wyld> I just *wish* I could afford a tip that reflected how much I admire you and enjoy hanging out
[07:40:25] <DoctorBooMD> captain crunch is my favorite froyo topping @TheSailCat

[07:41:49] <GosuCat> @Khostic, bot is hot
[07:41:50] <Shadowxdemon0> because the bot can vibrate
[07:41:51] <0wnda> you can actually, the steak will shrink while cooking.
[07:41:53] <TheSailCat> Chef's meat is too big Kappa
[07:41:56] <+Mrs_Wyld> bad with compliments? Then clearly you need more of them. A compliment is a gift Chef. Accept it as one if that makes it easier
[07:42:03] <Shadowxdemon0> oh is that something only i am interested in

[07:48:05] <newfieguy4> Your meat all falls down to this if you burn the steak to much i delete twitch forever @cheflethalplays
[07:48:09] <Belladonnarose> @cheflethalplays anything over medium to me is wrong. a filet should never be over medium rare.
[07:48:42] <rainbows1234> Yay I get to eat now

[07:50:29] <+Rosecreeper72> also remember steak should be at room temp when cooked

[07:51:17] <Belladonnarose> then pull it
[07:51:41] <@mrslethalplays> oh @Rosecreeper72 you just triggered him

[07:52:15] <aurorapop> can I has bacon recipe?
[07:52:22] <@Khostic> hai mrslethalplays
[07:52:22] <newfieguy4> Yup it all boils down to this steak if burnt im saying goodbye forever chefers >:-)
[07:52:24] <FlunkyMonkey> It is true though...if the steak it room temperature it cooks more venly
[07:52:24] <Ralerx> bacon better then dildo's
[07:52:28] <+Rosecreeper72> and maybe you should go back to chef school
[07:52:31] <Mellowcanuck> Steak is usually uniform in thickness so if its all the same temperature going in, it will cook at the same speed.
[07:52:39] <dank_rhythm> I cook mu steak with memes
[07:52:40] <+TwiztidDJ94> danWave @cheflethalplays

[08:22:17] <Mellowcanuck> @Mrs_Wyld Didn't think so, was wondering if that's where the creamy part came from.
[08:22:18] <@Khostic> Kreygasm
[08:22:30] <NateSnowstorm> danGasm
[08:22:31] <&+FakeGamerGirl> KreyGasm

[08:23:02] BAN: blankspaceblank (1s)
[08:23:05] <Buttfisk> T H I C C S O U P
[08:23:07] <blankspaceblank> what
[08:23:26] <@Khostic> space after your period
[08:23:30] <+Mrs_Wyld> so it has emulsified .. hence the creamy texture
[08:23:45] <DaddysGamerGiirl> what is the difference between olive oil, virgin olive oil and extra virgin olive oil?
[08:23:51] <Buttfisk> Chicken applesauce Kappa
[08:24:21] <blankspaceblank> yea looks like apple sauce
[08:24:25] <+Mrs_Wyld> DaddysGamerGiirl, whether the olives are heated when pressed and whether they are first or second pressing
[08:24:28] <Darkshadow0308> when are the foodgasms? sneakyGasm
[08:24:48] <DaddysGamerGiirl> oh okay thank
[08:24:49] <gamesPWNher> All the time @Darkshadow0308
[08:24:50] <+Mrs_Wyld> extra virgin is fresh olives first pressing ..
[08:24:54] <DaddysGamerGiirl> the more you know
[08:25:25] <+Mrs_Wyld> you're welcome DaddysGamerGiirl. I live in an area known for both wine and olives. Olive oil is serious business here :P
[08:25:45] <gamesPWNher> So lucky @Mrs_Wyld
[08:25:54] <DaddysGamerGiirl> al I know about wine is I like to drink it
[08:26:02] <gamesPWNher> If I lived near wine and olives I'd probably never move
[08:26:23] <Buttfisk> Put it in one of those bottle with a c02 cannister and foam it Kappa
[08:26:23] <+Mrs_Wyld> Chef this would go well with a few garlic croutons and a drizzle of olive oil .. and maybe some chervil or parsley?
[08:26:24] <DoctorBooMD> I live near a bunch of breweries @gamesPWNher it is dangerous
[08:26:41] <gamesPWNher> :o I used to live near a bunch of breweries @DoctorBooMD
[08:26:42] <blankspaceblank> Beet season just started here so i was thinking of trying some borscht
[08:26:44] <gamesPWNher> It was so dangerous
[08:26:58] <+Mrs_Wyld> I know gamesPWNher. Between the wineries, olive groves and several amazing cheeseries, we are spoiled rotten
