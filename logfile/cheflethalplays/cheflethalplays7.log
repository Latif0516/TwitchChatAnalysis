[08:10:07] <@CherryGryffon> Masaki's favourite snack of all time is Doritos
[08:10:09] <@Caitnippers> My cats all have different tastes. Its a pain.
[08:10:14] <@CherryGryffon> ^ Same, too
[08:10:22] <@CherryGryffon> Some like mint, some chips, some black olives, some grass
[08:10:29] <LottieLatte> I'm very timid about giving my cat food like I'm not sure what I can give here aha
[08:10:41] <@CherryGryffon> Then there's figuring out who likes salmon, tuna, or chicken. All like some, none like all D:
[08:10:42] <Xxmatentv123xx12> hey
[08:10:46] <Deakon99> dont buy pringles plz, its not a real chip
[08:10:50] <Xenoconway> I likes cats MVGame
[08:10:56] <Deakon99> sure the marketing is good, but nah
[08:10:57] <@Caitnippers> My little girl literally will hit me in the face for a chip
[08:11:07] <Xxmatentv123xx12> i'm reading the. menu and Idk what any of that is @cheflethalplays
[08:11:13] <Bakamon0> there was about an hour and a half more work it looks like
[08:11:17] <@CherryGryffon> Masaki actually snuck on my chair, and snagged a chip as it was on its way to my mouth
[08:11:19] <@CherryGryffon> sketchFail
[08:11:27] <@CherryGryffon> To this day, idk how the hell he managed it
[08:11:31] <Xxmatentv123xx12> i know what salsa verde
[08:11:37] <Deakon99> buy kettle chips if you want a good chip
[08:11:38] <Xxmatentv123xx12> is

[08:12:41] <Bakamon0> lol
[08:12:46] <Xenoconway> lol
[08:13:03] <@CherryGryffon> >_> I'm not eating dill pickle pringles right now. Nope
[08:13:04] <Bakamon0> how long do those corn chips need to cook for?
[08:13:11] <DaddysGamerGiirl> real or not, prinkles are soo good
[08:13:13] <@Caitnippers> sour cream & union cips tho
[08:13:14] <@Caitnippers> best
[08:13:25] <DaddysGamerGiirl> but I make my own chips, my son likes them better than the store bought chips
[08:13:30] <Bakamon0> figured so
[08:13:39] <Deakon99> the new dill chips are bad ass
[08:13:39] <DoctorBooMD> I'm weird I suppose, I only like plain chips
[08:13:52] <@CherryGryffon> SC&O is my mom's favourite, so I'm in the habit of not eating them even though I'm almost 30 haha
[08:13:53] <Deakon99> plain chips are yum
[08:13:53] <Xxmatentv123xx12> btw my mom made baked chicken breasts and threw baby carrots in with the chkn and she made rice Kreygasm so good. normally she throws Turkic in there but she didn't today
[08:13:55] <Xenoconway> @bakamon0 MVP Kreygasm
[08:14:01] <Xenoconway> @deakon99 DansGame
[08:14:01] <@CherryGryffon> I like Dill Pickle, and Salt & Vinegar :D
[08:14:01] <Bakamon0> the salsa should soften them up a little
[08:14:05] <@Caitnippers> Everyone has a different taste Doctor, you're not weird
[08:14:09] <Xxmatentv123xx12> for dinner earlier @cheflethalplays
[08:14:30] <LottieLatte> lmao
[08:14:34] <@CherryGryffon> Crunch crunh crunch
[08:14:38] <Bakamon0> you could make the salsa a little more runny so the chips absorb more
[08:14:40] <Deakon99> hard to cook corn tortillas in the oven
[08:14:43] <@CherryGryffon> *Crunching intensifies*

[08:31:34] <Bakamon0> clipperino
[08:31:48] <Nycozation> Why is the egg white not brown?
[08:31:58] <@^cheflethalbot> Monetary tips are ALWAYS used for the stream. Right now, Chef is saving up for a wireless microphone setup so all tips until October 15 will go towards that! Tips throughout the stream totalling $10 = DOGE/CAT CAM & Treats! (UPDATE: We hit the goal! Any new tips will go towards other stream enhancements!)
[08:32:08] <DaddysGamerGiirl> look at that jiggle

[08:33:21] <rainbows1234> they were asking why it was white, not brown
[08:33:26] <Kabinvex> The technique is op Kreygasm
[08:33:27] <rainbows1234> commas are important
[08:33:37] <JGrindal> Is the granite countertop NSF?
[08:33:39] <rainbows1234> like the shell btw
