[07:36:00] <BaconBrotato2470> slow cooker**
[07:36:04] <DaddysGamerGiirl> brings a whole new meaning t porking

Consisting of up to 3 rounds, raiders who bring along at least 5 viewers can test their luck by choosing to spin the wheels and potentially ruin Chef's plan for the stream!
[07:36:16] <Jarkeler> That air fryer thing looks like something Gorden Ramsay would never use
[07:36:59] <BaconBrotato2470> No, just like passing along great tools when I find them.
[07:37:50] <Butterwhales> the infinite power source! power your home and your blender and more

[07:57:23] <newfieguy4> Hi @mrslethalplays doin ok here , how are you doin?
[07:57:24] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> Pretty good
[07:57:24] <Prowling_Panther> hey mrslethal. how are u tonight?
[07:57:35] <DanHalen_> Well Chef, if you made your wife ketchup soup, maybe she wouldn't be talking dirty to other men! OpieOP
[07:57:51] <BaconBrotato2470> xD
[07:58:16] <@mrslethalplays> me too doc! i'm pooped, worked a lot in our yard today. cant wait for this soup tho!
[07:58:27] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> Chef, it wasn't quite to my expectations, but it has room for improvement. Next time... Next time will be better.
[07:58:28] <@mrslethalplays> truth dan
[07:58:33] <DaddysGamerGiirl> ketchip sould is tomato soup
[07:58:39] <DaddysGamerGiirl> ketchup*
[07:58:43] <DoctorBooMD> I bet, did you get everything you wanted to done?
[07:58:43] <DanHalen_> I guess it would be a mixture between ketchup and tomato soup
[07:59:00] <DanHalen_> slightly thicker tomato soup with a stronger, more puree-like taste
[07:59:01] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> End goal is to have it sufficiently good to serve when I invite a date over. :D
[07:59:03] <Jarkeler> What is he using the thin it out again?
[07:59:14] <DoctorBooMD> chicken stock I believe
[07:59:31] <BaconBrotato2470> Chef better ketchup, or he'll miss out
[07:59:40] <Jarkeler> Chicken stock makes everything better it seems
[07:59:56] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> Some would say Chef can be mean at times. But that's just because he beats the eggs, and whips the cream. Kappa
[07:59:58] <jitspoe> If you like chicken.
[08:00:02] <jitspoe> Sadly, I don't.
[08:00:13] <jitspoe> I chicken out when it comes to eating meat.
[08:00:19] <DoctorBooMD> to be honest stock is one of those things I always buy instead of make. It's cheap compared to how long it'd take me to make a good stock
[08:01:02] <newfieguy4> Chef I think I am going to change my name to "I'm Sylvester Stallone from Rambo" lol
[08:01:14] <BaconBrotato2470> use vegetable stock if you don't like meat
