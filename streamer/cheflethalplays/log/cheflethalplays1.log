[08:16:12] <@^cheflethalbot> Chef likes to wear latex gloves on his left (non-dominant) for most of the cutting done on stream. This is done for a mulitude of reasons, but mainly because it's easier than constantly having to stop and wash hands.

[08:45:25] <@Caitnippers> Later True <3
[08:45:29] <@mrslethalplays> Cauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea, in the family Brassicaceae. It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed.
[08:45:36] <Arianna_Celestine> it has less of a strong flavor (bland) which makes it suitable for stuff like crusts and sneaking into mac n cheese without kids noticing
[08:46:00] <@mscuppykate> wow Mrs Lethal with the science

[10:42:18] <@mrslethalplays> @jj100100110 thx for stopping by!
[10:42:29] <@Caitnippers> Can you win a cuddle session with the cats and lucy?

[10:42:40] <@Caitnippers> yaaas
[10:42:43] <@^cheflethalbot> Are you a streamer, or know someone who is and would like to potentially mess with Chef's stream?! Now you can with the Wheels of Spinach RAID GAME! Consisting of up to 3 rounds, raiders who bring along at least 5 viewers can test their luck by choosing to spin the wheels and potentially ruin Chef's plan for the stream!
[10:42:50] <@mrslethalplays> !pets
[10:42:50] <@^cheflethalbot> The Lethal family includes 4 animals! Lucy, Chef's American Staffordshire Terrier. Tuscany, a tortoise-shell domestic short-hair cat. Zelda, a gray domestic-short hair cat. You can take Zelda; she drives us crazy. But we're good parents :) AND our newest addition, Tyson: a kitten we fostered then ended up adopting who is too cute for his own good!
