[06:46:16] <@^cheflethalbot> Monetary tips are ALWAYS used for the stream. Right now, Chef is saving up for a wireless microphone setup so all tips until October 15 will go towards that! Tips throughout the stream totalling $10 = DOGE/CAT CAM & Treats! (UPDATE: We hit the goal! Any new tips will go towards other stream enhancements!)

[07:01:15] <@^cheflethalbot> Chef likes to wear latex gloves on his left (non-dominant) for most of the cutting done on stream. This is done for a mulitude of reasons, but mainly because it's easier than constantly having to stop and wash hands.
