[07:14:32] <Deakon99> vegans dont think vegetables are living thingd
[07:14:44] <Gotycki_Rosa> :D
[07:15:17] <@^cheflethalbot> Gotycki_rosa, that host accentuates your natural beauty quite nicely. Thank you!
[07:15:29] <xFlare25> so i heard this logic on good mythical morning: toilet paper is wood, wood is plants, plants are vegetables, vegetables are food. so toilet paper is food. can you confirm, as a chef? :D
[07:15:37] <kalira77> ok i will take all the things on the menu, please
[07:15:42] <Gotycki_Rosa> <3
[07:16:10] MOD: Mrslethalplays
[07:16:17] <DaddysGamerGiirl> drink it for $200.00
[07:16:21] <@Khostic> rofl drizz
[07:16:39] <arecklessbunn> i'd take a shot of that salty zucchini liquid
[07:16:42] <kalira77> see your logic fails at plants are vegetables
[07:16:44] <Deakon99> sweat the zuchinni much?
[07:16:56] <kalira77> veggies are plants, not all plants are veggies
[07:17:04] <xFlare25> :P
[07:17:06] <DoctorBooMD> maybe it'd ferment and go alcoholic by then
[07:17:07] <Deakon99> I would give you a penny to drink it
[07:17:09] <Gotycki_Rosa> lmao...
[07:17:20] <Gotycki_Rosa>* mind in gutter again
[07:17:30] <xFlare25> @kalira77, it's not my logic, i just thought it was funny
[07:17:31] <@PureKaos26> Drizz omg
[07:17:33] <@PureKaos26> lolololol
[07:17:36] <Deakon99> it's all about the process
[07:17:37] <@PureKaos26> that was a good episode
[07:17:53] <mecasu> !whatscookin
[07:17:54] <@^cheflethalbot> chefHat Seared scallops with a lemon buerre blanc (wine/butter sauce), enormous brussels sprouts seared in bacon fat, and zucchini fritters! chefHeart chefSkills
[07:17:56] <limnatide> You could take that backwards, not all food are vegetables not all plants are vegetables not all plants are wood not all wood is tp.
[07:18:05] <@PureKaos26> chocolate comes from beans, beans are a vegetable, chocolate is salad.
[07:18:09] <kalira77> it's always about the logic drizz
[07:18:18] <limnatide> I do like that one PUre
[07:18:35] <Gotycki_Rosa>* drools
[07:18:51] <xFlare25> what's on the cauliflower?
[07:19:24] <Deakon99> roasted cauli
[07:19:24] <DanHalen_> i could do with some good food right now
[07:19:28] <Deakon99> yum
[07:19:29] <DanHalen_> unfortunately, I don't have any
[07:19:30] <kalira77> why do you have a single glove? are you the michael jackson of the kitchen?
[07:19:37] <xFlare25> haha chocolate is salad
[07:19:38] <limnatide> !glove
[07:19:38] <@PureKaos26> !glove
[07:19:38] <@^cheflethalbot> Chef likes to wear latex gloves on his left (non-dominant) for most of the cutting done on stream. This is done for a mulitude of reasons, but mainly because it's easier than constantly having to stop and wash hands.
[07:19:39] <xFlare25> solid logic
[07:19:40] <@^cheflethalbot> Purekaos26 -> !glove is on cooldown for 60 seconds.
[07:19:51] <kalira77> kek
[07:20:26] <limnatide> I had a cousin who thought that recycled toilet paper was used toilet paper they made into new rolls
[07:20:28] <kalira77> ack... cameras are reversed from each other... that's going to mess with my brain
[07:20:36] <@PureKaos26> You had to point it out :(
[07:20:37] <DaddysGamerGiirl> you gonna do salmon steaks one day chef

[07:21:10] <@Khostic> how is a frog racist
[07:21:14] <@Khostic> what kind of bullshit is that
[07:21:17] <xFlare25> white supremacist memes
[07:21:37] <kalira77> is okay, not your fault.
[07:21:46] <rainbows1234> why is everything in this world racist
[07:21:54] <@Khostic> lemme tweet some pepe's at hillary clinton then
[07:21:56] <@PureKaos26> ...there are worse mascots, I suppose
[07:21:57] <@Khostic> rofl
[07:22:04] <xFlare25> people are cry babies, rainbow
[07:22:06] <DaddysGamerGiirl> how about cod for home made fish and chips
[07:22:09] <Raleda> Well, I mean.. if Hillary Clinton, Meme queen says so...

[07:22:44] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> I don't like the blurgasmur of sprouts
[07:22:51] <kalira77>* high fives @OnlyGingerWhenAngry
[07:23:16] <OnlyGingerWhenAngry> o/\o
[07:23:20] <DaddysGamerGiirl> i not a fan of coconut either, but i like coconut milk and coconut oil
[07:23:29] <limnatide> I am legit allergic to shellfish. So there's only probably one thing on this stream I'd eat lol
